# SourceCred Mission Tracking

SourceCred is an open-source credit attribution system. SourceCred analyzes
projects and assigns *cred* to each contributor, based on the value of their
contributions. You can read more about the vision on [our website], and you can
see our codebase in [sourcecred/sourcecred].

This repository is used for overall project management for SourceCred.
We'll use the [issues] to track things like key features we need to implement,
or milestones and objectives for the project as a whole.

If you have any questions, or just want to say "hi", please come by by [our
Discord instance].
